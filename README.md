# python-challenge

## Background

Transitioning from using Excel to programming with Python, I've undertaken an assignment involving two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. These tasks are designed to apply my new Python scripting skills to real-world scenarios.

## Before I Begin
Before starting the assignment, the following steps needs to be completed:

Before diving into the assignment, I followed these preparatory steps:

1. Repository Setup: Created a new repository named python-challenge.
2. Cloning the Repository: Cloned the repository to my local machine.
3. Directory Structure: Created two folders within the repository: PyBank and PyPoll.
4. File Preparation: Within each folder, added:
   - main.py: The main script for the analysis.
   - Resources folder: Contained the necessary CSV files.
   - analysis folder: Held the text file with the results of the analysis.
5. Pushing Changes: Committed and pushed these changes to GitHub/GitLab.

Objective
 Develop a Python script to analyze financial records in a dataset named budget_data.csv, containing two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Tasks
- Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.
- Compute the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the period.
- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the period and find the average of these changes.
- Identify the greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
- Identify the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).

Deliverables
- Print the analysis results to the terminal.
- Export a text file with the analysis results.

My analysis should align with the following results:

Objective
Create a Python script to modernize the vote-counting process using data from election_data.csv, which contains "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate" columns.

Tasks
- Determine the total number of votes cast.
- Generate a complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
- Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
- Identify the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Deliverables
- Print the analysis results to the terminal.
- Export a text file with the analysis results.

My analysis should align with the following results:

## Hints and Considerations
- Use Python modules like csv for file handling.
- Utilize data structures such as variables, lists, and dictionaries for data storage and manipulation.
- Employ iteration for processing data.
- Debug the scripts to ensure accuracy.
- Handle large datasets efficiently, showcasing the limitations of Excel and the advantages of Python scripting.

Workflow
1. Script Development: Write separate scripts for each dataset.
2. Testing: Run each script individually to verify functionality.
3. Version Control: Commit work regularly and push changes to GitHub to prevent data loss.
4. Documentation: Ensure the repository includes a comprehensive README.md file detailing the project.
